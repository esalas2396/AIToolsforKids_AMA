Ask Me Anything (AMA) is an open-source self-study project created for the purpose of testing and exposing K-12 students to the applications of AI. This project was created by Saniya Vahedian Movahed & Erika Salas

The front-end of the project was created using "CustomTkinter" which is a python UI-library based on Tkinter created by Tom Schmiansky (https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) and the back-end utilizes OpenAI ChatGPT-3 via prompt engineering.
